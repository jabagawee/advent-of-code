# Advent of Code 2017

These are my results in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
Hopefully I'll do it every day in December. Maybe not.

## Usage

To see solution(s) for a day, run the following:

```
./advent <day>
```

## New Solutions

To solve a new day, add a `code/day_<n>.py` file that implements a subclass of
`BaseSolution` that adds the `part_x` methods for each part of the solution.
